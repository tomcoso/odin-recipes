        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Traditional french cooking is all about time – time to reduce sauces and really concentrate 
            flavour. We show here that you can still get deep flavour in short time. By using tamari or 
            soy sauce which typically is not used in Indian cooking it gives that deeper umami note. The 
            coconut milk adds the creamy indulgent sweet quality to the sauce which offsets the acidity in 
            the tomatoes. We use 2 tins of chickpeas in this recipe which you could easily substitute with 
            any other cooked bean or lentil of choice.</p>
