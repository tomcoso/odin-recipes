        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup uncooked rice (185 g)</li>
            <li>½ cup peas (80 g)</li>
            <li>½ cup corn kernels (80 g)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oil, I used canola oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 carrot, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce or tamari</li>
            <li>½ tsp sesame oil (optional)</li>
            <li>2 green onions for garnish, sliced (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the rice according to package directions. 
                This recipe works even better with leftover rice, 
                so if you can, cook it the day before.</li>
            <li>If you use frozen peas and corn kernels, cook them 
                according to package directions. If you use them canned, 
                omit this step.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet, add the garlic, 
                onion, and carrots, and cook them over high heat for 
                about 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the peas and 
                corn kernels and cook for 2 more minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Add the rice, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Stir and cook for 
                2-3 more minutes or until the rice is hot, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Garnish with the green onions and serve your vegan fried rice 
                immediately mixed with tofu scramble, air fryer tofu, baked 
                tofu, or fried tofu.</li>
            <li>Keep the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up 
                to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>
